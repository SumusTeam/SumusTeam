## Summary

Nowadays, most cryptocurrency transactions are completed through traditional
exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance, and Bitfinex. However, despite the
increasing number of tokens and exchanges, the cryptocurrency industry still faces
issues such as security breaches, lack of liquidity, price manipulation by exchanges,
false trading volume via robots, and slow processing of orders and transactions.

The SUMUS Exchange is a revolutionary on-chain digital assets trading platform
that provides a robust, liquid-rich, and truly traceable transactions marketplace that
is specifically designed to address the aforementioned problems of current
centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. SUMUS is committed to
providing our traders with an intuitive user-interface, high liquidity, real-time
customer support, seamless cross-chaining, a safe and risk-free trading experience,
and low transaction fees.

## Consensus

SUMUS uses industry-leading distributed Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (sdBFT) 
algorithms to achieve consensus between nodes.
Proof of Work (PoW) requires high-energy mining equipment, which is often
vulnerable to 51% attacks. Proof of Stake (PoS) is not only easy to centralize but
vulnerable to sybil attacks, long-range attacks, etc.
By using the sdBFT consensus mechanism, we are more secure, provide higher
transaction processing speed, and smaller block generation time (dynamic 1 to 20
seconds).

## Unsafe platform architecture and storage of user assets: 
For centralized exchanges, exchange customers' crypto assets are stored in online
hot wallets that are vulnerable to malicious attacks. Binance, Bitfinex, MtGox,  
Coincheck, and Bithumb have all experienced malicious attacks by hackers and  
have collectively lost tens of billions of dollars in crypto assets.  
These exchanges do not have strong security infrastructure and models in their
hot  wallets. Additionally, a large amount of existing exchanges’ crypto assets are  
reserved in cold wallets and requires manual human management, which is highly 
dependent on the morality of the individual custodians (vulnerabilities including
but  not limited to: owner’s death, exit-scamming, or internal company theft) 
Once external attackers hack into their vulnerable platform, or if inside parties are 
corrupt, the crypto assets of the exchange can easily be stolen and the exchange  can
suffer significant financial losses.   

For decentralized exchanges (DEX), the cross-chain mechanism typically still needs  to 
be handled by traditional centralized servers, which contains huge risks. Current  
DEXs in the marketplace with “mature” blockchains have difficulty supporting  large-scale
transaction clearing and are not user-friendly. Therefore, existing  decentralized exchanges are difficult to replace centralized exchanges. 

In 2020, the number of stolen cryptocurrencies on exchanges increased 13x from  the 
previous year with an average of $2.7 million of crypto assets stolen every day,  which 
is approximately $1,860 per minute.  
Considering the irreversibility of cryptocurrency operations, it becomes very clear  
how important it is to emphasize the security architecture of a cryptocurrency  exchange platform.  

## Lack of liquidity: 

Insufficient trading volume and lack of liquidity are a few of the major problems  
faced in the cryptocurrency trading industry, especially in exchanges where user  
counts are low. This leads to difficulty in transaction completions for both  
professional and ordinary traders alike.  
Encrybit's research shows that 36% of people worry about the liquidity of an  
exchange before registering. On decentralized exchanges, liquidity has always been  a major problem due to the low volume of transactions that can be supported by  existing blockchain platforms. 
## Price manipulation and non-transparent transaction history: 
In a centralized exchange, creating fake trading volumes and manipulating prices 
are easy to conceal, as all executed trades are undisclosed. Unlike traditional  
financial markets, crypto exchanges do not accept the principle of offering the same  
price across all exchanges.  
As a result, the prices of each digital assets can, and have, varied greatly. The  
volume analysis report from the Blockchain Transparency Institute shows that  major 
exchanges, including HitBTC, Coinbene, and Huobi have manipulated trading  volumes with the help of trading bots.  
False transactions and prices interfere with the normal operations of the market,  
such as trading losses to users and a reduction of public trust in the cryptocurrency  
market, which can lead to long-term repercussions to the entire crypto asset trading  ecosystem. 

## Slow order, withdrawal, matching, and transaction processing: 
Another problem that users of cryptocurrency exchanges often face is the low rate  of 
order placement, withdrawal, matching, and closing of transactions. In general,  the 
scalability of the transaction matching engine is difficult to support high-volume  transactions.  
Therefore, users will face slow order processing, and the delays can result in trading  
losses. Additionally, the speed at which exchanges deposit and withdraw assets is  often 
uncertain, with a large number of human-made operational factors and is also  highly correlated with back-end code quality.
